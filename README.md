## Importance of Slope Stability Analysis:
•	Slope stability analysis is crucial in civil engineering for natural and man-made slopes to ensure safety in infrastructure construction.
•	Traditional methods determine the factor of safety, while new approaches assess the probability of failure or reliability of a slope.
## Role of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN):
•	Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are sophisticated modeling techniques used for predicting complex functions with two or more independent variables.
•	ANN plays a challenging role in predicting the stability of slopes by considering geological, groundwater, and soil strength factors.
## Methodology and Analysis:
•	The methodology involved preliminary soil investigation, including grain size analysis, liquid limit test, standard Proctor test, and triaxial test.
•	The project also included the development and analysis of the ANN model program.
## Neural Network in Machine Learning:
•	Neural networks can learn complex relationships between inputs and outputs, making them powerful in machine learning and AI.
•	They use multiple layers with various numbers of neurons to analyze and predict data.
## Neural Network Layers:
•	Neural networks consist of input, hidden, and output layers for data processing.
•	Training and testing sets help optimize network accuracy and effectiveness.
